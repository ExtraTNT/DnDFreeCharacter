	{Speak with Animals}% name

	{Action}% casting time
	{Self}% range

	{10 minutes}% duration
	You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM’s discretion.\linebreak

	{Action}% casting time
	{Touch}% range
	{S}% components
	{Concentration, up to 1 hour}% duration
	You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use your action to see through the beast’s eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.\linebreak

	{Commune with Nature}% name
	{5th-level Divination}% school
	{1 minute}% casting time
	{Self}% range
	{V, S}% components
	{Instantaneous}% duration
	You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.
\linebreak
	You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\linebreak
	\begin{itemize}
		\item terrain and bodies of water
		\item prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
		\item powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
		\item influence from other planes of existence
		\item buildings
	\end{itemize}
	For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.\linebreak
}
\def\FullFeature{
	\subsection{Darkvision}
	You can see in dim light within 60 ft of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
	\subsection{Wolf Form} As a Bonus Action you can change between your humanoid form and your wolf form. In your wolf form, you can not use any weapon or shield, only other wolfs and wolf-lycanthropics will understand you and your armor does not count on your ac, you have instead a ac of 12 + your dexterity modifier.
	\subsection{Wolf Sense.} In your wolf form, you have an advantage in perception checks that rely on hearing or smelling.
	\subsection{Bite} In your wolf form, your bite acts as a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your strength modifier instead of the normal damage.
	\subsection{Fey Ancestry.} In your humanoid form you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and magic can't put you to sleep.
	\subsection{Trance.} In your humanoid form you do not sleep. Instead you meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious for 4 hours a day. After resting this way you benefit from the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
	\subsection{Watcher's Eye} Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.
	\subsection{Rage}
	In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
		\item When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
		You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
		\item If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
	\end{itemize}
	Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
	\subsection{Unarmored Defense}
	While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
	\subsection{Danger Sense}
	At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
	\subsection{Reckless Attack}
	Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
	\subsection{Primal Knowledge}
	When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.
	\subsection{Extra Attack}
	Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
	\subsection{Fast Movement}
	Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.
	\subsection{Feral Instinct}
	By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
	\subsection{Brutal Critical}
	Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.
	\subsection{Spirit Seeker}
	Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the Beast Sense and Speak with Animals spells, but only as rituals.
	\subsection{Totem Spirit}
	At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.
	\subsubsection{Wolf}
	 While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.
	 \subsection{Aspect of the Beast}
	 At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
	 \subsubsection{Wolf}
	 You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.
	 \subsection{Spirit Walker}
	 At 10th level, you can cast the Commune with Nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.
	 \subsection{Dual Wielder}
	 You master fighting with two weapons, gaining the following benefits:
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
	 	\item You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one handed melee weapons you are wielding aren’t light.
	 	\item You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
